# Questions:
# How should numbers, peroids be handled. Yes to them in abreviations or no spec is confusing
# What exactly should I be adding to my vocabulary just subwords?
# how to handle start before each word? just add a start before every token? or just assume in BPE? Or Start in just start of sentences??
# how am I to return merge rules? number of merge rules or strings of the rules?
